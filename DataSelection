To ensure the inclusivity and diversity of the dataset, I employed a different approach during the data selection process. Navigating through the SDSS website's data interaction section provided me with a wealth of options to explore. Leveraging the "Navigate" tool, I sampled galaxies across different regions of the celestial sphere. By embracing randomness in my selection process, I aimed to capture a broad spectrum of galactic properties and characteristics. As I curated this virtual "notebook" of galaxies, I continuously assessed the diversity and representativeness of the sampled data. This iterative approach allowed me to refine my selection criteria and ensure the inclusion of a balanced assortment of galaxies spanning various types and magnitudes. Upon reaching a total of 15 galaxies in my "notebook," I extracted the corresponding dataset, thus securing a robust foundation for the subsequent analysis. The information obtained from the website is displayed in \ref{tab:table1}
