The visualization process began with the preparation of data stored in text files, primarily sourced from astronomical observations. Leveraging the command-line interface, raw data was accessed and manipulated using various text processing utilities. Through the terminal, data cleansing and formatting operations were conducted to ensure compatibility with subsequent analysis steps. Following this initial preprocessing phase, Python scripts were employed to orchestrate the visualization pipeline. Leveraging Python's extensive ecosystem of libraries, including but not limited to NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, the data was ingested, transformed, and ultimately rendered into insightful visualizations. Python scripts executed in the terminal environment orchestrated the entire process seamlessly, from data ingestion to the generation of rich graphical representations. This integrated approach facilitated the creation of dynamic and informative visualizations, empowering astronomers to explore and analyze complex astronomical phenomena with precision and clarity.
