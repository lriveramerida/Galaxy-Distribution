# Galaxy Distribution Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the distribution of galaxies using observational data obtained from astronomical surveys. The dataset contains information about various properties of galaxies, including their coordinates (right ascension and declination), magnitudes in different bands (u, g, r, i, z), and redshift.

## Dataset
The dataset provided consists of the following columns:
- **objid**: Object ID
- **specobjid**: Spectroscopic object ID
- **type**: Type of object (e.g., GALAXY)
- **ra**: Right ascension (in degrees)
- **dec**: Declination (in degrees)
- **u, g, r, i, z**: Magnitudes in different bands
- **redshift**: Redshift value

## Analysis
The analysis of the galaxy distribution data will include the following steps:

1.  **Redshift Distribution Analysis**: Calculate the redshift distribution of galaxies and plot a histogram or density plot to visualize the distribution of redshift values. Analyze the distribution and look for any peaks or trends that may indicate clusters or other structures in the universe.


## Conclusion
Through this comprehensive analysis, I aim to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of galaxies in the universe, which can contribute to our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics.
