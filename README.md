# Galaxy Distribution Analysis

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the distribution of galaxies using observational data obtained from astronomical surveys. The dataset contains information about various properties of galaxies, including their coordinates (right ascension and declination), magnitudes in different bands (u, g, r, i, z), and redshift.

## Dataset
The dataset provided consists of the following columns:
- **objid**: Object ID
- **specobjid**: Spectroscopic object ID
- **type**: Type of object (e.g., GALAXY)
- **ra**: Right ascension (in degrees)
- **dec**: Declination (in degrees)
- **u, g, r, i, z**: Magnitudes in different bands
- **redshift**: Redshift value

## Analysis
The analysis of the galaxy distribution data will include the following steps:

1. Statistical Analysis Results: Compile the statistical analysis findings into a dedicated file for future reference and analysis.
2. Galaxy Distribution Plot: Create a visualization depicting the spatial distribution of galaxies using Right Ascension (RA) and Declination (Dec) coordinates. Each data point on the plot represents a galaxy from the dataset, providing insights into their spatial arrangement across the celestial sphere.
3. Color-Color Diagram (u-g vs g-r): Generate a color-color diagram illustrating the relationship between magnitudes in different photometric bands, such as u-g and g-r. This diagram offers insights into the spectral characteristics of galaxies, revealing trends and correlations between their observed colors.


## Conclusion
Through this comprehensive analysis, I aim to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of galaxies in the universe, which can contribute to our understanding of cosmology and astrophysics.
