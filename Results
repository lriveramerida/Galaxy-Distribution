The statistical analysis of the galaxy data reveals intriguing insights into the characteristics of celestial objects within the dataset. The mean u magnitude, representing the brightness in ultraviolet light, is calculated to be 22.32. This value indicates the average intensity of this wavelength across the observed galaxies. Meanwhile, the median r magnitude, which measures the brightness in the red wavelength, stands at 20.48. This statistic provides a robust measure of the central tendency of the data, suggesting that the median brightness in the red spectrum is notably lower than the mean brightness in the ultraviolet spectrum. However, it's important to note that the standard deviation of the redshift is reported as "nan," indicating that there might be missing or undefined values in this attribute. Further investigation into the redshift data is warranted to better understand the distribution and variability of galactic velocities within the dataset.
