The dataset procured from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) encapsulates an array of astronomical information, offering a comprehensive snapshot of galaxies scattered across the area of the universe this data originated from. Each entry in the dataset comprises several attributes cataloged to delineate the  nature of these cosmic entities. Fundamental parameters such as object identification (objid) and spectroscopic object identification (specobjid) serve as unique identifiers, facilitating precise referencing and analysis. Moreover, the dataset encompasses crucial details regarding the type of object under scrutiny, ranging from galaxies to other celestial phenomena. The spatial coordinates of each galaxy, denoted by right ascension (ra) and declination (dec), provide vital positional information essential for mapping the spatial distribution of galaxies within the universe. Additionally, the dataset furnishes photometric measurements across multiple spectral bands (u, g, r, i, z), offering insights into the intrinsic luminosity and spectral characteristics of galaxies. Notably, the inclusion of redshift values further augments the dataset's utility, enabling astronomers to gauge the recession velocities and distances of galaxies with remarkable precision.
