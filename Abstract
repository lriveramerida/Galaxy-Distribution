This project dives into an analysis of galaxy distribution, utilizing a unique dataset personally selected sourced from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This dataset encompasses a diverse array of parameters, including object ID, type, celestial coordinates, magnitudes across multiple spectral bands (u, g, r, i, z), and pivotal redshift values. The primary objective entails meticulously computing the redshift distribution of galaxies, employing  visualization techniques such as histograms or density plots. Through this  examination, the aim is to unveil potential peaks or trends that may signify clusters or significant structures within the expansive cosmos. By leveraging the data from the SDSS, this analytical endeavor sheds light on the intricate spatial arrangement of galaxies and provides profound insights into the cosmic architecture and dynamic processes shaping the universe.
